<div class="container">
  <p> Human-made fires are caused by unattended campfires, the burning of debris, equipment use and malfunctions, carelessly tossed cigarettes, and purposeful acts of arson. One of the two natural origins of flames is lightning. They are sometimes inevitable because they are produced by a "act of God," such as a lightning strike. In some respects, all we can do is prepare as best we can for whatever happens.</p>

        <td> Don't leave the cigarette somewhere since it might start a fire. Tobacco is engineered to burn at temperatures beyond 700 degrees Celsius and stay lit, allowing it to smolder and ignite. As a result, leaving the cigarette somewhere might not be the greatest option.</td>
